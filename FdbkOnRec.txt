No sounds

Where do I put my fingers?

Crashes if I do not respond

When I restart, "session" is not retaining the information from my last run

Too many words for the response options, too much reading . . . get rid of "sure/probably/maybe", move the numbers closer together, and draw a faint dotted line b/w the 3's . . . 

No need to save the practice data

Generate and save recognition result (Hit, Miss, FA, CR)

If they enter the wrong session, can you keep it from starting over again? (not a big deal if not)

I think life will be easier if balanced_words doesn't have the index saved with it . . . 

Looks like the names of the files generated by encoding and retrieval are formatted differently, make them the same

Use line breaks to make super-long lines (like the string formatting commands when you are writing lines) readable

Instead of writing out the relationship between key presses, response types, and positions of the lines onscreen a couple of times, how about defining a dictionary once and then referring to that? Like this:

d['key_1'] = {'response':1, 'position':(-0.51,-0.25)}
d['key_2'] = {'response':2, 'position':(-0.3,-0.25)}
etc.

That way, when you get a key press you can just say response = d[key_pressed]['response'] and you can do choice.set(d[key_pressed]['position'].
